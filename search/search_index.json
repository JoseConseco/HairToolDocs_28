It is for Blender 2.79 but workflow is the same in blender 2.8 (TODO: make new one) Defining UV's \u00b6 In Hair Tool to create UVs we have to make material, which will hold UVs data. Material creation is done automatically by the addon, when you make uv. UV creation process in Hair Tool To UV map curve ribbons: go into UV editor and search for: \u2018 Hair UV \u2019 operator under spacebar search menu, and choose 'Draw UV's for Hair' Use Left click and drag rectangular shape, to define the UV bounds for texture.

It is workaround for Blender limitation (Blender can't create UV data for individual splines). Hopefully this can be simplified in future. Note: In you enabled: 'Random UV flip' in preferences you will alter the ribbons look by randomly mirroring UVs on splines, but this creates additional materials (one for each UV box)!

Material / UV Refresh \u00b6 The best way to edit hair material is to edit first material slot. But then we would like to update other materials slots too, while preserving UVs.

Those materials are then randomly applied to each curve strand. You can override random assignment by using 'Override spline UV' .

Generated hair will have material applied automatically, if you choose to 'generate ribbons' option ('generate ribbons' adds profile to hair curves) Parameters (F9 Key) \u00b6 Generation Method - Edge Centers or Vertex position Hair Type - generate Bezier, Nurbs or Poly curves. Radius - curve radius (when not using ribbons) Strands properties \u00b6 Control basic properties like generated curves amount, number of points per spline etc. You can use topology of grid surface to guide density of generated strands. In places where grid surface have denser loops you can generate more strands or give more points to each strand. Strands count - number of strands to generate Uniform Strands - Distribute strands uniformly. If not, then more strands will be placed at denser grid surface areas (in this case - more on right) Points per strand - How many points generate for each strand Uniform Points - Distribute points on strand uniformly. If not, then more points will be placed at denser grid surface areas (in this case - more on top) Offset to tip - Move spline points more toward tip Offset to root - Move spline points more toward root Basic randomization \u00b6 Randomize Spacing - Randomize spacing between strands Randomize Length - Randomize strands length Main Noise \u00b6 Gives hair the main flow direction. Noise Amplitude - Noise strength Seed - noise seed gives different hair flow for each value Noise frequency - gives more detail to hair flow. Higher frequency produces smaller detail on hair strands Constrain - Constrain noise movement to grid surface Transition Contrast - Contrast between areas with no noise to full noise influence, over strand length Transition Offset - Offset noise influence more toward the root (or tip) of strand Per strand noise \u00b6 Helps to break uniform look of Main noise. Per strand noise - Blend additional noise for each strand to break uniform look Mix / Add - add or mix extra strand noise on top of base noise Seed - additional noise seed Frequency - Per strand noise frequency. Higher frequency produces smaller detail on hair strands Snap or Uplift \u00b6 Move strands toward or away the source grid surface Offset Above - Offset strands above source grid surface Snap Amount Snap strands to source grid surface Ribbons \u00b6 For generating hair texture you may skip this option (curves with bevel depth will be OK for making hair maps). But for making hair cards, you should enable option below. Generate Ribbons - Add curve profile ot generated strands Strand Width - width of generated curve ribbon Align tilt - Align tilt to Surface Clumps \u00b6 Gives nice effect especially when you use 'Curves from Grid surface' to generate eyelashes. Clumps - Clump hair together.

It works by generating curves from grid mesh (made all of quads). Grid mesh topology is guiding hair strands flow.
