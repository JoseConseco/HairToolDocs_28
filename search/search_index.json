Smooth Curve \u00b6 Smooth Curve - smooth strand points (eg. to reduce noise) Smooth Tilt \u00b6 Smooth Tilt Taper Curve \u00b6 Taper Curve - change strands radius over length Align Curve tilt \u00b6 Align Curve tilt - lets you align cure tilt to target object surface. Randomize Curve Tilt \u00b6 Randomize Curve Tilt - change curve tilt over its length Select Tips/Roots \u00b6 Select Tips/Roots - lets you select first/last points on curves. There is randomize option under F6 properties. Ribbon operations: \u00b6 Add Ribbon Weights \u00b6 Add Ribbon Vertex Color - create black and white color gradient from strand root to tip Add Ribbon Weights \u00b6 Add Ribbon Weights - create vertex weight gradient from strand root to tip UV hair operator \u00b6 UV hair operator (found under spacebar) - Left click and draw multiple rectangular shapes, in uv Editor, to define the uv bounds for hair strands. Press enter to confirm. Convert operations \u00b6 Convert Particle Hair to (ribbon curves), curves to Particle hair, Grease Pencil to Curves etc.: Ribbon to Curves \u00b6 Ribbon to Curves/ Curves to Ribbon - allow for switching between ribbon curve and ribbon mesh state. Usually you will want to do hair modeling in curve state, and then do UV in ribbon mesh state. Particle Hairs to Curve \u00b6 Particle Hairs to Curve - generate curve ribbons from Particle hair. Align their tilt to head with 'Align Tilt' checkbox, and embed hair roots deeper into the scull using 'Embed Roots' parameter. Particle Hairs From Curve \u00b6 Particle Hair from Curves (this can be used to convert zbrush fibermesh to blender Particle Hair system). Select curves and target mesh (that will receive Particle Hair) and use ' Particle Hair from Curves ' to convert curves object to blenders Hair system. Ribbons from particle hair with children \u00b6 ' Ribbons from particle hair with children ' - gives more evenly distributed result compared to build-in child particles . Great for short Hair. Particle Hair From Grease Pencil \u00b6 ' Particle Hair From Grease Pencil ' strokes painted with grease pencil, can be converted to particle hair (with some options available under f6). Checkbox next to this button, describes if you want to use Scene GPencil data (when enabled), or Object GP data (when disabled). 'Flip UV' option in preferences - if enabled random strands will have uv's flipped in X-axis. GPencil to curve ribbon \u00b6 Grease Pencil to curve - quickly sketch gprease pencil guides, that will be converted to curve ribbons. Use F6 for options. If you run this operation with curve hair selected, it will add new curves to it. If you run it with mesh selected, then it will be used for as target for ribbons aligning and offset. Generate Braid \u00b6 Braids from curve - just select Source curve, and run 'Generate Braids' on it. As usual there are some options under the F6 button. After you are finish, original Source curve can influences the generated braid so you can twist it (ctrl +T), scale radius (alt+s) to change the sape of braid.","title":"Tools"},{"location":"Tools/#ribbon-operations","text":"","title":"Ribbon operations:"},{"location":"Tools/#curve-simplify","text":"Curve Simplify- Allows to reduce point count.
