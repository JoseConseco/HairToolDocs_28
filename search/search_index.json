Note: To avoid constant email notification update spam, I publish smaller updates/bugfixes without version number bump. Only after implementing enough of new features/bugfixes publish official new version with increased release number. If you want go grab 'smaller' bugfixes, but addon shows, that you already have the latest version, use Reinstall Current Version . It will download these smaller incremental bugfixes. You can also download updates manually by getting new zip file from your Gumroad account. You should have received download link to zip file, with email when you purchased Hair Tool. Note: It seems auto-updater does not work on Mac OS. As a Mac user you will have to download update manually from Gumroad account. Now it should work on Mac too.

You can also generate: Braids Curly hair . Curve ribbons to mesh ribbons \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Ribbon to Curves/ Curves to Ribbon - allow for switching between curve ribbons and mesh ribbons. Usually you will do the hair modeling in curve mode, and then, on export, convert them to mesh. This operator ensures that curves UVs are properly converted to mesh UVs. Finalize Hair \u00b6 When you want to export your character with hair usually you would have to: Convert curve hair to mesh hair Join mesh hair with character body (it is destructive operation, so usually you would create copies each object before joining the duplicates) finally export merged-duplicated object Finalize Hair is doing all of above (except exporting) in one step. Just select curve hair (or mesh hair), your character object an run 'Finalize hair' to get merged copy that is ready to export. You can remove exported duplicated object after that. Particle Hairs to Curve \u00b6 Particle Hairs to Curve - generate curve ribbons from Particle hair. Align their tilt to head with 'Align Tilt' checkbox, and embed hair roots deeper into the scull using 'Embed Roots' parameter. Particle Hairs From Curve \u00b6 Particle Hair from Curves (this can be used to convert zbrush fibermesh to blender Particle Hair system). Select curves and target mesh (that will receive Particle Hair) and use ' Particle Hair from Curves ' to convert curves object to blenders Hair system. Generate Braids \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. To generate Braids - select one or more splines from curve object, and run 'Generate Braid'. You can access operator properties from F9 hotkey. After finishing operation, originally selected splines will be separated - each into its own object, and they will deform the generated braid. This way you will be able to twist (ctrl +T), scale radius (alt+s) or move generated braids. Note : If you want to adjust braid later on - just re-run braid operator, while having braid object selected. Parameters: (F9 Key) Points per interlace - Amount of points per braid interlace. Length - braid length multiplier (actual length is calculated from selected spline length) Frequency - Frequency describes how many times hair strand interlacing will occur Main Radius - Overall braid radius Strand Radius - Individual strands radius Radius falloff - Change braid size over strand length (tapers the braid on the tip) Equalize radii - Equalize radii for braids with different lengths (when generating multiple braids) Generate Curly hair \u00b6 To generate Curls - select one or more splines from curve object, and run 'Generate Curls'. You can access operator properties from F9 hotkey. After finishing operation, originally selected splines will be separated - each into its own object, and they will deform the generated braid. Parameters: (F9 Key) Points per cycle - Amount of points per curl cycle. Bigger values gives smoother curls Curl frequency - Will generate more curls but also higher point count Radius - Curls Radius Uniform spacing - Distribute stand points uniformly along strand length Adjust Tilt - Make curve profile face outwards direction.

How do I export hair? \u00b6 Hair generated in Hair Tool can be exported just like any other mesh (File -> Export -> FBX). Just make sure to convert Curves to Mesh hair first. How do I export hair texture? \u00b6 If you are using default Hair Tool hair material, then it is using just one texture - alpha mask. You can export it from UV Editor (or Image Editor) -> Image menu -> Save as: Note : Build-in HTool hair shader has complicated shader nodes setup, that allows them to look nice in Eevee. It is impossible to copy it to another game engines. If you want to create more complicated setup, with multiple texture types, you should use Hair Baking scene, where you can set up you hair and bake them as images to target directory. How do I animate Hair? \u00b6 There is no one way to animate hair, but usually I recommend using simple softbody mesh as deformer for actual hair like it is shown in video below: There is now built-in option to animate hair using Jiggle Bones see Animation Error when using Curves from Grid surface \u00b6 Make sure your source grid surface has proper topology.

Hair Tool give you easy option, to generate bones and weight paint data for your hair cards. You can animate generated bones using simple jiggle physics. Note : This only works on mesh hair (there is no way to rig curves in blender). Bones Setup \u00b6 To create bones for selected mesh strands (islands): convert curve hair to mesh using Curves to Mesh In mesh edit mode select hair strands (mesh islands) that you want to animate. Open Hair Tool Pie menu using Ctrl+Shift+H -> select 'Generate Bones' now you can tweak option for bone generation (bones count, starting position, etc) If you already have armature object assigned to your character it is recommended that you point Hair Tool to it by setting 'Target Rig' property. With that, generated bones will be automatically assigned to your character rig. Also remember to setup 'Pin bone' - this bone will be automatically set as parent for generated hair bone chains. Usually character 'head' bone can be used as 'pin bone' (hair bones parent) Bones Setup - parameters \u00b6 Bones Start - Place first bone at some start distance from strand root location Offset To Tip - Bunch up generated bones more toward strand tip Assign jiggle - Assign jiggle physics to generated bones Bones Count - Bones Count Bones Generation Mode - Generate separate bone chain for each selected mesh strand, or generate only one chain for mesh island with active face/edge/face (other selected islands will use active chain for skining - good for clumps) Jiggle Physics Setup \u00b6 If you enabled ' Assign Jiggle ' when creating bones, then HT will automatically add jiggle physics to new bones. You can edit jiggle physics in armature POSE MODE : change time step add collision to selected bones (other bones will bounce from collision bone) create jiggle physics presets (with various mass, stiffness, damping, gravity parameters) and assign these presets to selected bones Simulation Mode \u00b6 Jiggle Physics can be run in two Modes: Interactive - good for mouse interaction with jiggle bones, but it won't work when rendering animation Animated - only works when animation playback is enabled. Useful when rendering animation. There is also option to bake jiggle sim into animation using those steps Physics presets \u00b6 You can create multiple physics presets in Hair Tool using [+] icon. Your browser does not support the video tag. To assign physics preset to bones: select target bones open triangle menu and select 'Assign jiggle to bones' you can remove selected bones from preset using same menu Note : If you have any bones selected when creating new physics preset, then those bones will be automatically assigned to new physics preset. Baking Jiggle Animation \u00b6 Jiggle physics can be baked to animation using following steps: select jiggle bones object mode > animation > bake action, with these settings: only selected bones visual keying overwrite current action bake bones (not object) Don't forget to turn simulation off after baking BEFORE rendering, or you will get unexpected results.

As a result if you have two curve hair objects sharing same material , they both will share same UV too. If you wan to separate UVs, then you have to separate (un-instance) material on both curves. If you want two curves to have same UV - just link Material from one to the other. Here is video explaining material creation Optimal UV workflow \u00b6 The optimal workflow for creation an assigning hair UVs (UVs are stored in hairs material): Select curve hair object Define UV regions like shown in Defining UVs . This will create hair materials that holds UV data Manually assign UV's boxes to selected strands with Set UV region Link materials (that hold UV's) created in second step, to other hair object and repeat third step Note1: Do not use Blender's buildin 'Convert-To->Mesh' operator on curve hair, or your output mesh UVs will be messed up. Instead use Curve ribbons to mesh ribbons . This way curve Material UVs will be properly, converted to mesh UVs. Defining UV's \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Defining UV regions in Hair Tool from UV image editor How to create curve hair UVs: open UV Image Editor and press \u2018 Hair UV \u2019 button located in top header bar - on far right next use Left Click and drag rectangular shape, to define the UV bounds for texture mapping. You can drag corners of existing UV box to adjust its shape. To remove UV box, hover your mouse over one of uv boxes and press [Delete] key To reset UV press Shift + Delete Each UV box will create one material. So if you made 5 UV boxes, then addon will create 5 materials (times two if you have enabled 'Random UV flip' in addon preferences). Note1: 'Random UV flip' option in addon preferences, will create additional X-axis mirrored UVs, that can be randomly assigned to hair strands. This doubles material count Note2: If you want to flip strand texture in Y direction, just hover your mouse over UV box and press 'F'! Offset UV \u00b6 It moves UV points more toward the root or tip on hair strand. As a result you can stretch UVs and change texture look. See video below: Your browser does not support the video tag. To use UV Offset just hover you mouse over UV box and scroll with MMB. Material / UV Refresh \u00b6 Hair Tool is assigning multiple materials to hair curve object, as workaround for lack of UV re-mapping on curves. However, if you want to change hair material you would have to: - modify first material slot - then manually change all remaining material slots one by one. This is where 'Material / UV Refresh' comes to rescue. Changes done to first material slot, will be automatically propagated to remaining material slot when you use 'Material / UV Refresh'. Material / UV Refresh with random seed option. It changes random hair strands materials assignment Set UV region \u00b6 Map selected strands UV to specific uv box by its ID number Note : UV box ID numbers can be previewed using 'Hair UV' button see: Defining UVs In Hair Tool UV is stored in material data. This means if you made three UV boxes then addon will create/assign three materials to selected object (if you enabled 'Random UV flip' in addons preferences, then mat count is doubled). Those three materials (UV boxes), can be assigned to each curve strand using 'Set UV region' Note : you can assign material slots to hair strands manually using Blender's build-in 'Assign' button from Material Tab, but 'Set UV region' provides additional randomization option - where selected strands will randomly pick one of selected UV boxes IDs. Your browser does not support the video tag. Set selected strands UV to one of three, user defined, UV boxes by using theirs IDs.

We can also assign UV/Material based on strands length with 'Length masked Uvs' Hair UV Curls \u00b6 This option allows creating low-poly curly hair effect on hair objects that have round profile (resulting in pipe like curves). Curly UV's settings are stored in material, thus each material can have unique curls look. On the other hand if your hair have one material, then all curls will look exactly the same on all splines. Your browser does not support the video tag. We can assign UV curls for individual UV regions one by one. Or shift select multiple IDs to assign UV Curls to multiple regions (with optional randomization - by setting min range value) In the above video I used two UV Regions, thus we get two materials (plus additional two for the mirrored UV).

I made it similar to blender Particle System, but based on Geometry Nodes, and more flexible (hopefully easier to use too). It works as stack of Systems, each of them build from its own sub-stack of strands generators and modifiers ( Deformers ), that you can put on top of each other and slowly build up complexity over time. All systems can be linked together with usage of Tags Hair System is located in Right Sidebar \u2192 Hair Tool Tab \u2192 Hair System Panel. Click [+] to add Hair System to selected mesh/curve Last but not least it can output many kinds of hair profiles , which makes it good for game hair creation. Hair Setup \u00b6 Creating Hair Systems \u00b6 Hair System can be assigned to mesh or curve object (one is required, but you need both to get full functionality). Adding Hair system to mesh is possible, but you will have to manually pick guide object (if necessary). This setup is used in Hair Tool Baking scene. When Curve is selected, Hair Tool will check if surface mesh is assigned to it, and will use both. This is what you will usually want to use. If no surface mesh was detected you will be able to use limited functionality of Hair System (no child strands spawning) Your browser does not support the video tag. To create Hair System select curve or mesh, and click [+] icon in Hair System Panel Note : 'Old' curves cannot have any bevel depth or use profile object, or they won't work correctly as guide (Hair System will see them as mesh, not as curve) Note : If you assigned Hair System to curve, then you won't be able to convert it to mesh. In that case use Transfer Hair System option. Transfer Hair System \u00b6 Transfers Hair System from Curve to Mesh or vice versa. Visually there will be/should not be any difference. Useful when you want to convert new Blender Hair Curves to mesh, to export, but you assigned Hair System to Curve (they do not support converting to mesh). Above Hair System was assigned to Curve ('HairCurves' obj). Transfer Hair System operator will create 'source surface' copy ('basic_scalp') and move Hair System to that copy. 'Convert To Mesh' will work now Set As Child \u00b6 Settings System as Child will allow you to use additional hair effects: clumping, interpolation, curls and twist. Your browser does not support the video tag. In video above we want set second Hair System as child of first one. Tag first system as A , then, in second system, we set parent tag as: A . Finally enable parent by clicking on link icon. Interpolation, clumping and other effects can be used now Hair Interpolation \u00b6 To enable hair interpolation, current Hair System has to have parent - see above . After that Toggle Interpolation button will be accessible in first deformer - Strands Generator - properties Hair System Copy/Paste \u00b6 You can copy settings from any hair system, and paste to target using entries above. Pasting Hair System settings (or instancing object that uses Hair System), will create linked copy. This means that any change on new copy, will affect original Hair System too. Number of Hair System users is displayed next to Hair Tag (green box above). Note: You can unlink Hair System, by clicking on 'users number' (see green box above) Tags \u00b6 You can think of Tags as labels assigned to Hair System strands. Thanks to Tags you can set child-parent relations or affect only tagged strands with deformers. Why don't we just use system name - rather than introducing new feature? The difference is you can assign multiple tags to same strand e.g.: System A: LONG and CURLY . System B: LONG Now you can modify LONG tag without having to repeat same operations on system A and B twice. In addition, Tags can be assigned to subset of strands from within Hair System: you can use vertex group to select right half of hair strands and tag them as CURLY . Later you can modify only this tag or use it as parent. Tags Used for Parenting (unlocks hair clumping, interpolation and twisting). Now 'First' Hair System can now follow GUIDE tag - assigned to separate HairCurves object You can assign Tag in two ways: by typing it in next to system name see A tag in image above. If not tag was assigned then [TAG] label is shown by using Assign Tag Deformer you can also assign tags to Hair System guide objects (new Curve Hair) from Tags Panel Parent Tag can be entered, next to the chain icon - on the very right. Enable chain icon, to set current system as child of Tagged one. Tags Panel \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. In video above we create Tag A , then assign selected curves to tag A using Assign button Note : Assigning Tags only works on new Hair Curves. To be able to select individual curves, like in video above, you have to use Hair Modeling mode . For now only selection works from all the available Modeling Tools Hair Deformers \u00b6 They allow to procedurally change chair look in non-destructive and in linear way (meaning can be stacked one after another in similar way than Blender modifiers can). Each hair deformer can be reordered and some can be influenced by previous Hair Systems if Set as Child (eg. Clump or Twist deformer) Strands Generator / Filter \u00b6 First slot in deformer stack, cannot be removed. Acts in binary way: Generator - (comb icon) will generate strands that are later affected by all subsequent deformers in stack Your browser does not support the video tag. Strands Generator - The defalul mode. Can be Set as child Filter - won't generate strands. Instead, it will take in strand from all preceding Hair Systems (you can use 'Affect Tag' button to filter only subset of strands). Those filtered strands are then affected by all subsequent deformers in current stack. Your browser does not support the video tag. Clicking on Comb icon, will switch current Strands Generator to Strands Filter. After that current deformer stack will influence only preceding Hair Systems The idea behind Strands Filter mode is - rather than modify multiple Hair System one by one e.g. adding Set Radius or Align Tilt to each of them, one by one, you should rather tag those systems, then create new Hair System at the end of stack, set it to 'Filter' -> Affect Tag -> input Tag name that you want to influence. This way you can modify all of those strands in one place. Note : If you want to affect only part of visible hair you can enable ' Affect Tag ' option - and type int Tag of hairstrands that you want to modify. Noise Deformer \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Add noise distortion to strands Curls/Waves \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Adds curls/wavy effect to hair strands Trim \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. It will shorten strands roots and/or tips. Best to use with randomization mask Clumps \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Clumps hair toward parent strands. Effect requires to set Hair System to be set as child Twist \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Twist effect requires to set Hair System to be set as child . For best effect is is good idea to place it after Clump deformer Assign Tag \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Here we assign R tag to right side of head (using vertex group). Then in following 'Scale' Hair System we can reffer to this tag using Strands Filter -> Affect Tag. This way only right side is affected (Scaled) Note : Assigning any tag e.g. X will create negative tag 'X, for example if we create tag RIGHT with some strands, then tag 'RIGHT will contain opposite set of strands. Add Tilt \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Add tilt to hair strands. If 'Flip Probability' is 0.5 - then half strands will be rotated clockwise and half counter clockwise Align Tilt \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Aligns tilt to target surface (hair normal will point outside of surface) Instance on Strand \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Instance any mesh on hair Strands (can be used to eg. add tie and tail on the end of braid) - since HTool 2.44 Push Out \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Push hair outside/inside surface. Useful for embedding hair roots into mesh surface (use inverted 'Influence Range') Scale \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Scale hair up or down. With trim deformer we can reduce length of hair, but Scale deformer helps to make them longer. Snap \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Snap hair to source surface (could be used for wet hair effect) Slide Points \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Give more resolution to hair root or tips (depending on 'Influence Range'), by 'sliding' points along the curves Set Radius \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Set Radius - for hair tapering, strand width randomization, etc Input Masks \u00b6 You can mask most of the hair deformers inputs with various kind of effects. Multiple masks can be added. Note : The order matters: first top mask is evaluated then next to the bottom Your browser does not support the video tag. To add mask click drop down menu icon on right and pick mask type Vertex Group/Texture \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Vertex Group/Texture : Use vertex group or texture for input masking* Offset/Gain \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Mask Offset Gain : Not useful by itself, but placed after another mask, it can increase the mask contrast (gain) or brightness (offset)* Invert \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Invert : Not useful by itself, but placed after another mask, it will invert the previous mask effect Randomize \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Randomize : Outputs random value for each strand. Random value will be picked from within [x-RandRange; x+RandRange] bounds, where x - is any input value - e.g. from vertex group mask You can disable lower/upper bound using < / > buttons, thus limiting Random value range. Rand Range - 0 - no randomization; 1 - maximum randomization Variance < 0.5 outputs mostly smaller values, from within given range, Variance == 0.5 all random values are drawn uniformly, from within given range, Variance < 0.5 outputs mostly bigger values, from within given range, Use Parent IDs - if enabled each child strand will inherit random value from its closest parent. Length Mask \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Assigns Min value to the shortest strands, Assigns Max value to the longest strands. Swapping Min and Max values will invert the effect Procedural Mask \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Procedural Mask : Use procedural noise texture to randomize hair look. No need for UVs Min, Max - bring these values closer together to get sharper noise transition, Scale - the bigger scale the more detailed the texture will be, Distort - distorts the noise, Offset - offset the noise sampling position Influence Range \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Special mask that allows to modulate influence of deformer over strand length (e.g. taper only tip of strand). 0 - no effect, 1 - maximum effect Types of Influence range masks: Constant - the effect is uniform along the whole strand length Simple - gradually changes the influence from 0 to 100%. Influence can be flipped using invert button Quadratic - gives more detailed control: modulate effect independently at strand beginning, center and end Profile Curve - most detailed control using profile curve Defining Uvs \u00b6 Defining UVs \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Hair Uvs button works same way as for any other hair object. You can click and drag to define multiple UV regions. Since HTool 2.44 you can define multiple UVs regions (previously only one UV Region was supported) Make sure Hair System has material assigned in 'Profile' properties (or use Import Default Material ) Material UVs are outputted by 'Offset Node' - without it UVs won't work. After converting Hair System to mesh, you can use 'normal' mesh uvs (Offset node is not required) Hair System does not use multiple materials hack like we had to do for 'old' Curves 'Hair UV' operator will automatically add UV Region Set Deformer (see below) if it does not yet exist. Assigning UV Regions \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. You can use multiple 'Set UV Regions' Deformers, and stack them on top of each other (think of them as layers). In video above, I used 2nd Region (green) as base layer, then added 0th Region (purple) on top - masked by vertex group You can also use Set UV Region , and it will automatically create new 'UV Region Set' Deformer (or use active one if selected in Deformer Stack) If not UVs were assigned to current Hair System object, then running 'Set UV Regions' operator will add default UVs (with single UV box/region) Hair Profiles \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Presentation of hair profiles available for Hair System No Profile - useful for new Curve Hair rendering (controlled in 'Curves' Panel in Cycles/Eevee Render Settings) Round Profile - used in Hair Tool baking setup Mesh Profile - replace hair strands with mesh (or collection of meshes) - e.g. you can instance feathers on hair Curve Profile - (with UV's) - any curve object can be used as custom hair profile Flat Profile - (with UV's) - AKA haircards, Circle Profile - (with UV's) - same as above, but it will generate cylinders Braid Profile - (with UV's) - generate procedural braids on each haircard Braid Profile \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. In demo above you can see both curve taper and tilt is affecting the generated braids shape Frequency - how dense braid interlacing is Main Radius - overall braid size Profile Radius - individual strands size (relative to Main Radius) Braid Resolution Factor - how many points should be generated for each period on braid (higher == smoother look) Radius Slide - The smaller the radius of guide curve, the more dense the braid becomes. Helps to give uniform look, when guide hair tapers Curls Profile \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Curls Profile solves the issue of Curls Deformer - it has perfect aligning of haircard to center of guide curve (new in HTool 2.44) Frequency - how 'dense' curls are Amplitude - overall curls size Width - hair-card width Gravity - Curls get tenser at the endings Influence Range - Blend between straight strand and curl over strand length Influence Width - control the strand width over its length Mesh Profile \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. In this case I used Collection with 3 objects, to instance them along hair strands Mesh profile objects should point up, and theirs origin be at the bottom. Otherwise, they may not align correctly to hair strands. Their length is not normalized, meaning taller objects will be longer after placing on hair strands (you may need to match profile objects height by hand, to give them same length). Width - changes cross-section size of mesh when its is placed on top of curve Slice Mesh Profile button will cut object using custom 'slicing' modifier. This way it will conform better to hair splines - only. Button is displayed next to Profile dropdown menu '\u2713' Note : Slice Mesh Profile is using boolean operation in background. It may fail on more complicated objects - e.g. when mesh has self intersections. UV's of mesh profile objects will be preserved when instanced on top of hair. Using multiple copies of same objects with different UVs is a good way to add some randomization to hair look. Generate Attributes \u00b6 Generate extra attributes like: Tangent - required for proper specular highlights (only if you use Hair Tool hair material) Factor - black and white gradient along each strand length Random - each haircard will get random grayscale color Sample UV - plug in UV name that you want transfer from Source Surface mesh to strands (new in 2.41) Sample Color - plug in vertex Color name that you want transfer from Source Surface mesh to strands (new in 2.41) Simplify Strands \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Simplify Strands optimizes polycount of generated hair geometry, by assigning less points to shorter strands. This can easily cut polycount in half! Updating \u00b6 After updating Hair Tool add-on, there may be changes in Hair System nodes, that you wish to transfer to your old blend file: for example HTool update for Blender 3.4 added better tilt support in Mesh Profile , but your project is using old 'Mesh Profile' You may update deformer, profile, mask etc. nodes using menu above Note : If bigger changes were deployed in new HTool release, or your Hair System is not working correctly your last chance for fix is: Update Whole Hair System - this will update all nodes, in all Hair Systems for all objects on scene. Be warned though: add-on will try to recreate whole node tree structure from scratch, so this may now always work. Using individual node packs update (only Deformers, or only Masks etc.) method is usually safer . Limitations \u00b6 Only One UV box can be assigned to profile - you can use Mesh Profile with multiple meshes as a workaround for randomizing UVs Hair Modeling Tools do not work (except selection) Hair interpolation is using booleans under the hood. Because of this, interpolation may fail if boolean fails. And Interpolation may be slow on heavy base meshes (I recommend using lowpoly hair surface meshes). Hopefully I will find better way in the future, to create interpolations. You can't convert Hair System to mesh if it was assigned to new Hair Curve.

To create Hair System select curve or mesh, and click [+] icon in Hair System Panel Note : 'Old' curves cannot have any bevel depth or use profile object, or they won't work correctly as guide (Hair System will see them as mesh, not as curve) Note : If you assigned Hair System to curve, then you won't be able to convert it to mesh.

In this modeling technique we are instancing haircards on mesh edges (haircard count will be the same as character mesh edges count). Useful for creation of fur. Note Short Hair modeling requires Blender 3.1 or above. The main advantages: easy to setup - one click solution easy to tweak with blender sculpting tools (or with poly modeling) haircards distribution based on source character mesh topology - you will automatically get denser hair in more important areas: head, hands (but this can be con - depending on situation) The main cons: no easy way to control density - since density is based on source character mesh topology (you cant drive it with e.g. vertex group) hair source mesh has to have same topology as hair guide mesh. This mean you may have to start combing from scratch if change base mesh topology (but there is workaround I will show later) Note : You can tweak haircards density by changing base mesh topology - eg. by using remesh modifier or adaptive tessellation in blender sculpt mode. How To use \u00b6 Select your character. Let's assume it is named: Body Use Ctrl+Shift+H menu -> 'Setup Short Hair' Alternatively you can use: right sidebar (N key) -> Hair Tool Tab -> Short Hair panel -> 'Setup Short Hair' Two new objects will be added: Body_short_hair (hair object) and Body_hair_guide (drawn as bounding box) Select hair guide object (bounding box) and go into sculpt mode that is it, you can now sculpt hair by sculpting guide mesh (polygonal modeling can be used too) Note To finalize Short hair use 'Convert Short Hair to Mesh' from Hair Tool Ctrl+Shift+H menu. This will correctly tranfser UVs from modifier to mesh data Remeshing Modes: \u00b6 When you use 'Setup Short Hair' operator, you will have option to remesh base geometry (or leave it as it is). Since haircards are spawned on each mesh edge, then source mesh topology has big influence on Short Hair look Three main modes of remeshing starting from left: Diamonds, Triangulated Diamonds, Triangulated Cells Base Suzanne is made from around 1000 edges. Meaning Short Hair will spawn 1000 haircards (planes or ribbons) Diamond Topology will create 2000 edges Diamond Triangulated will create 3000 edges Triangulated Cells will output 4600 edges! Cells remeshing - gives highest poly-count but the resulting topology is organic and thanks to this haircards will also be distributed in natural way. Diamonds topology, on the other hand, has visible repeating pattern and it may show through on generated haircards. Triangulation of Diamonds helps slightly, but it is not as good as Cells Topology Note 1 : If you want denser haircards you can add subdivision modifier to your base mesh, but resulting edges count will quadruple Note 2 : I did not test it, but using Dynotopo topology from sculpt mode may actually be nice way to get organic and controllable mesh Defining UVs \u00b6 UV workflow for Short Hair is similar to Curve UVs. Select Short Hair object open UV Image Editor and press \u2018Hair UV\u2019 button located in top header bar - on far right then draw UV boxes like it is shown in Defining UVs . The only difference, compared to curves, is that UV mirroring is automatically enabled. Uv Region defined above can be distributed/assigned to hair-cards in two ways - using Vertex Groups as UV mask, or manually. Manual UV assignment \u00b6 You can manually select mesh parts and assign uv regions to it Set UV Region : Select Short Hair object, and go into Edit Mode (using Tab key) Select edges for which you want to assign new UV regions Use Ctrl + Shift + H menu -> Set UV Region , and pick UVs that you want to assign to selection. Short Hair Cards generated at these edges will receive new UVs. Set UVs using Vertex Groups \u00b6 Semi-automatic way of assigning UVs using Vertex groups (access from right Sidebar -> Hair Tool Tab -> Short Hair panel) We have [L]eft and [R]ight vertex groups. We can use these to assign different UV regions With above setup, UV_1 region will be assigned to hair-cards on [L]eft, and UV_2 region on [R]ight Note : First entry (Base UV) in vert Group layers is always used as 'Background' layer - meaning UV regions assigned to it, will be distributed on whole character body. Following vertex groups will cover this base layer, with theirs own UV regions. Parameters: \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. You can change Short Hair parameters by going into modifiers tab. Use Guide Object - You may want to use the modifier without Hair Guide object. This boolean parameter helps to turn off Guide object, without breaking modifier behavior Your browser does not support the video tag. Guide Object - Haircards will follow Guide Object deformations. It does not matter if you modify Deformer object in sculpt mode or in Edit mode, but you can't change Deformer object topology .

Noise - Helps to break the even look of haircards Coloring Strands \u00b6 Short Hair cards can be colored using vertex color or texture from character body. Both method require setting 'Sampled Object' input - from which we will pick color or/and uv data. Using Sampled Vert Color \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag.

Sampled Color - Enter UV name from sampled base mesh (usually character object) to generate uv layer named SampledUV - it can be used to tint the hair color* FAQ \u00b6 How setup uniform hair density? \u00b6 You can use remesh modifier to make the base topology even. Generating Short Hair from that should give uniform look I need denser hair \u00b6 There is no way to control Short Hair density. But you can add subdivision modifier to increase the density.

In this modeling technique we are instancing haircards on mesh edges (haircard count will be the same as character mesh edges count). Useful for creation of fur. Note Short Hair modeling requires Blender 3.1 or above. The main advantages: easy to setup - one click solution easy to tweak with blender sculpting tools (or with poly modeling) haircards distribution based on source character mesh topology - you will automatically get denser hair in more important areas: head, hands (but this can be con - depending on situation) The main cons: no easy way to control density - since density is based on source character mesh topology (you cant drive it with e.g. vertex group) hair source mesh has to have same topology as hair guide mesh. This mean you may have to start combing from scratch if change base mesh topology (but there is workaround I will show later) Note : You can tweak haircards density by changing base mesh topology - eg. by using remesh modifier or adaptive tessellation in blender sculpt mode.","title":"Short Hair Modeling Tool"},{"location":"main_workflows/short_hair/#how-to-use","text":"Select your character. Let's assume it is named: Body Use Ctrl+Shift+H menu -> 'Setup Short Hair' Alternatively you can use: right sidebar (N key) -> Hair Tool Tab -> Short Hair panel -> 'Setup Short Hair' Two new objects will be added: Body_short_hair (hair object) and Body_hair_guide (drawn as bounding box) Select hair guide object (bounding box) and go into sculpt mode that is it, you can now sculpt hair by sculpting guide mesh (polygonal modeling can be used too) Note To finalize Short hair use 'Convert Short Hair to Mesh' from Hair Tool Ctrl+Shift+H menu. This will correctly tranfser UVs from modifier to mesh data","title":"How To use"},{"location":"main_workflows/short_hair/#remeshing-modes","text":"When you use 'Setup Short Hair' operator, you will have option to remesh base geometry (or leave it as it is). Since haircards are spawned on each mesh edge, then source mesh topology has big influence on Short Hair look Three main modes of remeshing starting from left: Diamonds, Triangulated Diamonds, Triangulated Cells Base Suzanne is made from around 1000 edges. Meaning Short Hair will spawn 1000 haircards (planes or ribbons) Diamond Topology will create 2000 edges Diamond Triangulated will create 3000 edges Triangulated Cells will output 4600 edges! Cells remeshing - gives highest poly-count but the resulting topology is organic and thanks to this haircards will also be distributed in natural way. Diamonds topology, on the other hand, has visible repeating pattern and it may show through on generated haircards. Triangulation of Diamonds helps slightly, but it is not as good as Cells Topology Note 1 : If you want denser haircards you can add subdivision modifier to your base mesh, but resulting edges count will quadruple Note 2 : I did not test it, but using Dynotopo topology from sculpt mode may actually be nice way to get organic and controllable mesh","title":"Remeshing Modes:"},{"location":"main_workflows/short_hair/#defining-uvs","text":"UV workflow for Short Hair is similar to Curve UVs.
